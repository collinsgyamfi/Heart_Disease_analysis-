# Heart Diseases Analysis Dashboard
Heart disease has been a leading cause of mortality worldwide for decades. Understanding heart disease trends, risk factors, and outcomes is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies, allocating healthcare resources, and improving public health. Comprehensive data analysis is essential to drive informed decision-making in the healthcare industry.
This project aims to analyze heart disease data and create an interactive dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects of heart diseases, including survival rates, average age of survival, total survival, total death, and the impact of factors like smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and anemia on different age groups.

## Data Preparation

1. **Data Source**: The data used for this analysis is from the `heart_Disease_Dataset.xlsx` file.
2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: The data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query in Power BI. This included handling missing values, converting data types, and creating new calculated columns.
3. **Data Modeling**: The data was modeled in Power BI to create the necessary relationships between tables and measures.

## Dashboard Development

The dashboard consists of the following key elements:

1. **Gender**: Displays the distribution of heart disease cases by gender.
2. **Survival Rate**: Displays the overall survival rate of heart disease patients.
3. **Avg Age of Survival**: Displays the average age of survival for heart disease patients.
4. **Total Survival**: Displays the total number of heart disease patients who survived.
5. **Total Death**: Displays the total number of heart disease patients who died.
6. **Avg_Age_of_survival**: Displays the average age of survival for heart disease patients.
7. **Survival_Rate by Age Group**: Displays the survival rate of heart disease patients by age group.
8. **Survival Count and Avg of Ejection fraction by Age Group**: Displays the survival count and average ejection fraction by age group.
9. **Survival Count and Avg of serum creatinine by Age Group**: Displays the survival count and average serum creatinine by age group.
10. **Survival_Rate by Age Group**: Displays the survival rate of heart disease patients by age group.
11. **Impact of Smoking, High_blood_pressure, Diabetes and Anaemia by Age Group**: Displays the impact of various risk factors on heart disease by age group.

## Key Insights and Recommendations

1. **Survival Rate**: The overall survival rate for heart disease patients is 67.89%, which is a positive indicator.
2. **Age Group Insights**:
   - The 61-70 age group has the highest survival rate at 75.90%.
   - The below 40 age group has the lowest survival rate at 30.00%.
   - The average age of survival is 58.76 years.
3. **Risk Factor Insights**:
   - Smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and anemia have a significant impact on heart disease across all age groups.
   - The impact of these risk factors increases with age, with the 71-80 and below 40 age groups being the most affected.
4. **Recommendations**:
   - Implement targeted prevention and early intervention programs, especially for the younger and older age groups, to address the high-risk factors.
   - Promote healthy lifestyle habits, such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, and quitting smoking, to reduce the risk of heart disease.
   - Encourage regular check-ups and monitoring of key health indicators, such as blood pressure and blood sugar levels, to facilitate early detection and management of heart disease.

## Conclusion

The Heart Diseases Analysis Dashboard provides valuable insights into the survival rates, risk factors, and age-related trends of heart disease patients. These insights can help healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the general public better understand the challenges and opportunities in addressing heart disease. By implementing the recommended strategies, we can work towards improving the overall outcomes for heart disease patients.
